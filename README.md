"TEXT CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS: UNDERSTANDING AND CLASSIFYING TEXTUAL DATA"

# Welcome to the Text Classification Analysis project! 

The main goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to analyse and categorise text data from Twitter.
It offers an entire framework for developing and implementing text classification models that automatically classify tweets into predetermined categories.
Text classification is essential for applications like sentiment analysis, subject classification, and content categorization because twitter is a rich source of current information and opinions. I was able to preprocess and convert the twitter text input, train robust classification models, and assess the performance of those models using machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques.

# Pipeline
* Prepare and preprocess the Twitter text data
* Performed Feature Extraction
* Train and fine-tune multiple classification models
* Evaluate the performance of trained models using various metrics
* Deploy the best-performing model for real-world classification tasks

# Key Features
**Text Classification**: The project employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to perform text classification on Twitter data. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, model evaluation and model deployment.
  
**Multiple Classes**: This project supports text classification into six distinct categories: 
* Arts & Culture
* Business & Entrepreneur
* Daily life 
* Pop culture
* Science & Technology
* Sport & Gaming
* These categories are specifically designed to capture the various topics discussed on Twitter.

**Employing robust preprocessing steps**:including tokenization, lowercasing, and stopword removal, to ensure clean and high-quality data for training and classification and Harnessing advanced feature extraction techniques such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.

**Model Selection and Evaluation**:
This project enables the evaluation and comparison of different machine learning models( Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, and Random forest Classifier) for accurate classification. It includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the effectiveness of each model. Then the best-performing model was selected for deployment.

**Scalable and Efficient**:
The project incorporates scalable techniques to handle the high volume and fast-paced nature of Twitter data. It leverages advanced preprocessing methods and vectorization techniques, such as ((TF-IDF)Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and (BOW)Bag-of-words), to transform text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models and the difference between each transformation method was evaluated.

**Easy Integration and Deployment**
The project provides a user-friendly interface and well-documented code to facilitate seamless integration into existing systems or workflows. Trained models can be deployed in production environments or utilized via APIs to classify new Twitter text data.

# Installation
To get started with the Text Classification Analysis project, please follow the installation steps outlined below
* Clone the repository
  * git clone https://github.com/p-ojakovo/Text-classifier.git 
* Navigate to the project directory
 * cd Text-classifer 
* Creating a virtual environment
   * python -m venv venv 
 * Activating the environment on macOS/linux
  * source venv/bin/activate 
 * Activating the environment for Windows
  * venv\Scripts\activate 
* Install the required dependencies
  * pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Usage
* Prepare your training data
Organize your Twitter text data into labeled categories: Arts & Culture, Business & Entrepreneur, Daily life, Pop culture, Science & Technology, and Sport & Gaming.
* Preprocess the text data in order to be ready for training and modelling
Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the Twitter text data:
such as text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction.
* Split your data into training and testing sets.
* Train the text classification models
* Evaluate the models: Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and based on the evaluation result, select the best model 
* Deploy the model: once you have selected the best model, you can deploy it in your desired application or environment.
